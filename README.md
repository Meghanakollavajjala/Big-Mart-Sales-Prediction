# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of products in different Big Mart stores using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing various features like item type, outlet size, and item MRP, the model helps retailers make informed business decisions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Retail stores like Big Mart have large product inventories, and sales prediction helps optimize stock levels, pricing strategies, and revenue management. This project leverages **Regression models** to estimate future sales based on historical data.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains sales data of various products across multiple stores.
- Features include **Item Identifier, Item Weight, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, Item MRP**, etc.
- The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `Pandas` – Data preprocessing & analysis  
  - `NumPy` – Numerical computations  
  - `Matplotlib & Seaborn` – Data visualization  
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine learning models  
  - `XGBoost` (if used) – Advanced regression  

## 📌 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (creating new features)
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying trends and relationships between features
   - Visualizing data distributions and correlations

3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Tried multiple regression models:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Tree Regressor**
     - **Random Forest Regressor**
     - **XGBoost Regressor** (if implemented)
   - Performed **hyperparameter tuning** for better accuracy.

4. **Evaluation & Results**
   - Metrics used:
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
     - **R² Score**  
   - Compared model performances and selected the best approach.
